        <h3>Hackathon</h3>

        <p>A hackathon is just an opportunity for folks to come together and collaborate on existing projects or jump start new projects. We'll say it again: newbies welcome!</p>
        
        <p>You can... hack on a government open source project, help out with a research project, browse around our projects and share user feedback, play with open data, or just come stop by and meet other cool women in digital gov. We'll send out more specifics closer to the event.</p>
        
        <p>We're planning to work on open source gov projects from 18F and other agencies. <!--Please submit your ideas in the registration form!--></p>
        
        <h3>Training</h3>
        
        <p>We're offering training and workshops on all kinds of topics. You can attend training all day if you prefer, but we encourage you to also spend some time checking out the hackathon.</p>
        
        <p>Some of the training might include... open source collaboration and GitHub, jekyll, APIs, UX, Python, JavaScript, open data in government, HTML/CSS, and elasticsearch. We'll wait to determine the exact classes based on your responses and requests when registering.</p>
        
        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
        
        <p>Bring your laptop, government-issued ID (to get in to the government building), and creative energy!</p>
